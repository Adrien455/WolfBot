# WolfBot

WolfBot is a Node.js bot for the game Wolvesville.
It interacts with clan chat through commands to execute automated tasks.

## Getting started

### Clone repository :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adrien455/WolfBot.git
cd WolfBot
```

### Install dependencies :

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration :

### API Key :

Create an .env file at the repository root and put your personal api key:

```env
API_KEY = "MY_API_KEY"
```
**⚠️ Warning :** This file must stay **confidential**. You can reset it in game's settings in case of accidental push / any leaks.

### Config.js :

Set your clan and users IDs in `config.js` :

```js
const CLAN_ID = "MY_CLAN_ID";
const OWNER_ID = "OWNER_ID";
const DEVS_IDS = [
    "DEV_ID1",
    "DEV_ID2",
] 
```

You can retrieve IDs using [wolvesville api](https://api-docs.wolvesville.com/).
See the [documentation](https://api-docs.wolvesville.com/) for the endpoints.

**⚠️ Warning :** The players included in `DEVS_IDS` have accessed at **debugging commands** that can modify internal data. Only add trusted members.

## Run bot :

```bash
node app.js
```

## Behaviour :

- Greets new members with : `Welcome <member_name> !`.

## Commands :

### Prefix : `!`

- `!greet` → Says hi.

- `!claim` → 
    - Selects the most voted gold quest.
    - In case of tie the **last encountered** one will be selected.
    - Does not take votes for shuffle into account. 
    - Updates member participation status based on contribution. 
    - Required amount : **500 gold** (const for now).
    - Contributions are tracked from bot startup only.

- `!shuffle` → Shuffles available quests.

- `!skip` → Skips waiting time between two quest stages.

- `!extend` → Extends given time for a quest stage.

## Debugging Commands :

Restricted to players included in `DEVS_IDS`.

- `!balance` -> Adds 500 gold to the balance of a member (in localdata only).

- `!log` -> Logs the database of members.

- `!clear` → Clear cached quests and members.

## Notes

- This bot is currently designed to work in a **single clan** (id is hardcoded).

- It relies on **polling** (no webhook allowed) and continuously checks clan messages, clan logs and clan ledger.

- Adding this bot to another clan will have no effect.
